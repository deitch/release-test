# release-test

Includes various tests of github actions. Normally, these are part of larger workflows,
which makes testing actual changes ot the workflows slow and difficult. I use this
repo to test various changes. You **cannot** rely on this repo being stable.
I can and _will_ push changes to `master` or `main` branch as I see fit.

You are welcome to duplicate this repo, as well as collaborate with me, if you have
a test that would work here.
